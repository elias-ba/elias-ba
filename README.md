# Elias Waly Ba

*I build software as infrastructure for people.*

<br>

Senior engineer at [OpenFn](https://github.com/OpenFn), crafting open-source workflow automation for governments and NGOs.
Founder of [GalsenAI](https://github.com/GalsenAICommunity), nurturing AI community in Senegal.

<br>

The best tools disappear into the workflow.
Most hard problems are socio-technical, not purely technical.
Open source is a responsibility, not just a license.
Sustainable software comes from clear thinking, not hype.
