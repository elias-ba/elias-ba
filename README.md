# Hi, I'm Elias

**I build software as infrastructure for people.**

Senior software engineer at [OpenFn](https://github.com/OpenFn), building open-source workflow automation for governments, NGOs, and public institutions. Founder of [GalsenAI](https://github.com/GalsenAICommunity), growing AI literacy and community in Senegal.

## What I believe

- The best tools **disappear into the workflow**
- Most hard problems are **socio-technical**, not purely technical
- Open source is not a license — it's a responsibility
- AI is powerful, but **understanding > prediction**
- Sustainable software comes from **clear thinking, not hype**

## Let's connect

I'm interested in conversations about open source, AI for public interest, teaching, and building things that outlive trends.
