### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a curious individual passionate about bridging gaps between places and people. My interests lie in machine intelligence, data and systems integration, and the open-source movement.

Currently, I am part of the team at [OpenFn](https://github.com/OpenFn), where we are developing [Lightning](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning), a Digital Public Good (DPG) aimed at simplifying complex data and systems integration processes.

In my commitment to empowering the youth in Africa, I founded [GalsenAI](https://twitter.com/galsenai) and [Galsen Coding Challenges](https://twitter.com/GalsenCoding). These organizations are dedicated to nurturing young African talents in AI and technology. Additionally, I share my knowledge by teaching software engineering and machine learning.
