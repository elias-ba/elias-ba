### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”˜ I am a very curious person who loves using software engineering to solve problems in society.

ðŸ”˜ I believe in building bridges between places and humans.

ðŸ”˜ I am interested in machine intelligence, data & systems integration, and open source.  

ðŸ”˜ I am currently at [OpenFn](https://github.com/OpenFn) building [Lightning](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning), a DPG, for automating complex data & systems integration.

ðŸ”˜ I founded [GalsenAI](https://github.com/Galsenaicommunity/), one of the most active AI communities in Africa.

ðŸ”˜ I teach software engineering and machine learning during my free time

I speak Python, Elixir, English, French, Fula, and Wolof. And I am curious enough to learn any other language that allows me to communicate with computers and humans.
