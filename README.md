### Hi there 👋

- 🐤 ... I am currently building [Lightning](https://demo.openfn.org/), a Digital Public Good, providing a web UI to visually manage and execute complex workflow automation and data integration projects.
- 🌁 ... I believe in building bridges between places
- 🏃 ... I like to try hard things and learn along the way
- 💬 ... Ask me anything about `data`, `automation`, and `software engineering`.
- 💌 ... Find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eliaswalyba) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eliaswalyba/).
